Personal website and microblog for myself. This is just the frontend for an ongoing webserver project. The frontend is deployed via Cloudflare Pages.

## Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the frontend in development mode. The frontend will be served on port `3000``.

> [!NOTE]  
> This will open the website to the public.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the frontend and place the output in the `dist` directory.
