An interesting parable, this story seems to depict the extremes in decision making: risky and risk adverse. Over speculation on the evil king's part didn't necessarily affect him in any significant way; he still ate his food. However, he triple-crossed himself and indicated to the good king --apparently a simple guy-- that he will always have an ulterior motive, something to advance his agenda.
