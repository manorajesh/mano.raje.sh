Empathy is a defining feature of our brains: the ability to metaphorically relive another's experiences as if they are your own. Empathy allow us to understand more of ourselves and other people, giving us a lens through which to grow our own experiences. It also allows us to help others and ourselves by broadening the scope and awareness of a certain experience. This unique ability allows one to push beyond just one's experiences in perspective; however, if one is *too* empathic towards another, they may start to act on their behalf even though the other beneficiary may not approve of so. We can see this in modern tolerance-intolerance constructs as people are so empathetic of others, only a homogenous, typical notion of thinking is allowed.
