title: Handling Conflict

Usually, I try to avoid conflict by all means necessary. I do not enjoy being under attack nor attacking others. However, I sometimes get so annoyed or fired up that I would entertain conflict; I wouldn't start it, but once it is started, I would continue it. I try to approach conflict with a reasonable perspective, trying to understand the *other's* standpoint. Hopefully, by trying to maintain a calmer perspective, the people inciting conflict would cool down, and we can then address the matter at hand without using ad hominem attacks. Even though it doesn't always work, the other person may try to match my level and potential emotion on a topic, leaving any brash or insulting language behind.
