**What is your experience with ChatGPT?**

**What are your thoughts?**

I, not unlike many others, have spent extensive time with ChatGPT and similar chatbots. Overall, it is an unprecedented tool at one's disposal. So unprecedented that there is little regulation or safeguards in place to protect the users. Not only could a tool with this amount of data collection and proficiency with hundreds of fields be used by bad actors, it could _become_ that bad actor. Although that plot point has been hidden away in sci-fi novels and stories, the rate at which it improves and develops is practically exponential. All a large models needs is data, and the internet is just data.
