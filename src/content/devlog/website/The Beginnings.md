I am not sure why a website appealed to me. The concept of blogging when nobody (for now) would even read my posts was
an interesting concept. A _if-a-tree-falls-in-a-forest-and-nobody-is-around-to-hear-it-does-it-make-a-sound_ kind of
idea.

I think the idea of having a place to catalog my thoughts was the main appeal. I would see huge lists of lengthy posts,
spanning literally decades for some people. Something about returning to a state of mind or a project from years ago --exactly
as it was-- was the closest to time travel I could get.
